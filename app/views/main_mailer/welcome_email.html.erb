    <h1>Hello <%= @mail %>!</h1>
    <p>
      It looks like you tried to send me an e-mail with an awesome note to remember, but I can do it if you don't have an account with us :(<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      but don't be sad!, you can go to <a HREF="http://www.ReMND.it"> www.ReMND.it </a> to open an account and I'll be saving your notes in no time!
    </p>
    <p>Thank you for your interest and I hope to hear from you soon!</p>
